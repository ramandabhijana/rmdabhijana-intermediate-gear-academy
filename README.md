# Wordle Game

> Check out the course [here](https://academy.gear.foundation/courses/intermediate-course)

Final examination project in Gear Academy's intermediate course where I got to put into practice Gear's unique actor-based model, asynchronous messaging, and delayed processing by building a simple word-guessing game.

There is a couple of programs, the core Wordle program itself provided as a template, and a proxy program called Game Session which I was tasked with completing. In short the user interacts with the Game Session program to play Wordle which manages the game flow by invoking the Wordle program to start the game, check guesses, and analyze results including accuracy, attempts, and timing.

## Rewards

After completion of the course, I was eligible to [claim 4,421 VARA](https://vara.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x56bab32d36ef23a873a7f9359b041a7d19db9b488b703e887a6d72d1171929cb) which was worth around $100 USD at that time. Definitely give the course a shot. Totally worth it.
